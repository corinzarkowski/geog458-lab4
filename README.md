# The best places to live for a skier who loves the city

## Description
In this assignment I attempt to find the best places for skiers to live, based off both locations of ski areas and major cities. My examined area consists of the continental United States--Alaska would have been nice to include, but was not worth the extra processing time it would have incurred. Zoom levels of max8 and min5 are the same on each tileset--they are meant to be viewed in tandem.

My first endeavor was to create a basemap--for this I really wanted to keep it simple, but make some minor changes to demonstrate my understanding of MapBox.
I used a light monochrome basemap as a base, and minimized font sizes for minor cities, erased minor roads, added a little color, and enlarged/changed fonts for state names.

Next, I needed data on ski areas in the United States. Sadly, this data was not aggregated anywhere, so I had to do it myself. I wrote a quick little python script with a lot of regex to go through wikipedia and scrape names and coordinates of all ski areas located in the United States. After attaining the raw data, I reformatted it to geojson for further use--the raw ski area location data is visible below.

Honestly, this alone provides a pretty good look into where you would want to live as a skier. To expand on this, I did some data wrangling and made a choropleth of states by ski areas within their boundaries. There is one ski area exactly on the border of Montana and Idaho, so I decided that since it is pretty much accessible from both states, it should be counted within both. I sourced the state lines shapefile from a MapBox tutorial, which sourced it from a leaflet tutorial.

This map provides a good look into the best states to live in as a skier, but especially in mountainous areas, a whole state is not specific enough to provide valuable insight on good places to live and ski. So, I found a [github gist](https://gist.github.com/Miserlou) with names and coordinates of the top 1000 cities based on population in the United States. Since I'm a big city boy, I chose only the top 100 on this list to work with. I then did a little more data wrangling in calculating the closest city to each ski area, and grouped the cities by ski area count. Unexpectedly, the East Coast shines here! Maybe I should have accounted for ski area size and weighted them to provide a better picture. However, if somebody was just looking for somewhere, anywhere, to ski, this would still be helpful.

In the end, I think this shows a pretty helpful picture of cities with the most nearby ski areas. I definitely didnt expect there to be so many in the Northeast! If I were to change some aspects of my final map, I would label ski areas/cities and weight ski areas by size. Below is a picture of ski areas, the choropleth, and cities together.
